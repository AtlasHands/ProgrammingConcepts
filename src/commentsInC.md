# Comments in C
Comments are extremely important and easy to convey.  
  
Comments do not run when the program itself runs, they just helps to document your code.  
  
Its helpful if other people look at your code or even for yourself in the future. Often when reviewing my own code I would be lost if I had not commented what the code was doing. Sometimes the solution you find for a problem may be very niche or strange, if you look back at it without commenting it may just become unknown code you're afraid to change in fear of breaking the total process.

# Examples of comments in C

```C
	//This is a line comment!
	/*This is a multi line comment!
	You can keep going as long as its between the start and end tags
	You can also use these tags to comment out code for testing!*/
	/*: Start Tag
	End Tag: */
	//Example of code commented out
	//int a = 10;
	//int b = 20;

	/*
	int a = 10;
	int b = 20;
	*/

```
This book will use comments frequently in code examples to convey ideas
