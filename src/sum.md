# Summary

The purpose of this book is to get people familiar with programming concepts that are shared by all languages so that people can efficiently program in whatever language that they need to based on common concepts that they share.  
  
In this book I will try to expose you to many concepts and underlying processes that are happening when they present themselves in programming.  
  
We will start with the programming language c and then move into more languages because I think its better to learn how to program with more rigor then move into programming that has less rigor so that its easier to see the benefits and drawbacks of each language
